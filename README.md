# shopify-express-nextjs-typescript
This is a Shopify app boilerplate based on node, express, nextjs and typescript

## It includes:

- Next.js
- Express custom server
- Typescript
- CSS Modules
- Shopify CLI ready
- Prettier

## Usage:

To start a local dev server:

`$ yarn dev`

If you have shopify-cli installed, you can run it and use ngrok to tunnel the connection to your shopify admin:

`$ shopify app serve node`

This way you can enable hot reloading and see your dev changes immediately in the Shopify's admin. And that's awesome.
